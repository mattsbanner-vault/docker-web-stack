# Docker Based PHP Development Environment
**This project is currently WIP.**

> A full PHP development environment run within Docker. Includes NGINX, PHP 5.6, PHP 7.0, PHP 7.1, PHP 7.2, PHP 7.3, PHP 7.4, MySQL with a replication instance, PHPMyAdmin, MongoDB, Mongo Express, Redis, Redis Commander, Mailhog and Portainer to monitor the whole shebang.

## To Do
Here you can see what I'm working on.
- [ ] Setup MySQL Replication

- [ ] Implement each version of PHP to the NGINX config and allow to specify PHP version in hostname
